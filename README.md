# SVG Logo Generator

The SVG Logo Generator application was created to run on the node terminal and using user prompts and validation, create a one-to-three letter svg logo. The user will provide the text, text color, shape, and shape color to the application which will be used to render a svg logo. 




## Features

- User prompt using npm inquirer library to obtain user inputs for text, text color, logo shape, and shape color, with validation to ensure acceptable answers.
- Color validation in the prompts will happen using the Validate-Color npm library. 
- Object-Oriented Programming is used to setup this code with ansestor and child classes, to reduce redundancy.
- Jest npm library is used to do unit testing on the shape classes.
- SVG logo file is generated following the prompts, with the user specified text, shape, and colors and inserted into the output folder.
